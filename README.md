# SnippetServe frontend

## Getting Started

* Run `yarn start`.

## Contributing

* Clone this repo.
* Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
* Create a new branch named `trello-id/feature`. For example `235x53/oauth-implementation`
* Made & commit your changes. Husky will execute commands for eslint and prettier after you run `git commit`
* If husky throws any errors you can autofix most of these errors by running `yarn lintFix`. If errors persist even after this, then you have to manually fix these. You can use vscode to do so. Just hover over the error and vscode will show you a suggestion(`ctrl + .` also works on windows).
* After fixing all errors, push to the above branch that you created and then raise a PR to master.
* You will need at least 1 approvals before your changes get merged into master.
